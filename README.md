# MySite

Build and host a site showing my work and links to external sites


## Home page

<img src="./src/media/HomPage.JPG" />

This is going to be an animated navbar, 6 links 

- Me
- projects
- async article (to add more in future)
- and three links to github, LinkedIn and Twitter

Ran into problems with putting the images in the navbar, then looked up how to add icons. React has a package that solved this 😁

### Links 
- external links up and running

Thinking of using React Route to move between the three other pages
