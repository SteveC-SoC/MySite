# WORK IN PROGRESS
# My Site

Build and host a site showing my work and links to external sites


## Home page

<img src="./src/media/HomPage.JPG" />

This is going to be an animated navbar, 6 links 

- Me
- projects
- async article (to add more in future)
- and three links to github, LinkedIn and Twitter

Ran into problems with putting the images in the navbar, then looked up how to add icons. React has a package that solved this üòÅ

- [React Icons link](https://dev.to/kevsmss/easiest-way-to-use-icons-in-react-h0o)

### Links 
- external links up and running
- need to add text of what icon is for when hovering on them ‚úî

Thinking of using React Route to move between the three other pages, need to refresh myself on using this

[React Route](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

Route is working, but I don't want this at the top of the page, will need to look into this.
